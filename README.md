Description
 
 I used HTML , CSS and JavaScript to make this website. I had used queries such as (getELementByID, getElementByClassName, querySelector, QuerySelectorAll) in javascript. I used getBoundingClientRect() to know the position of elements along the DOM. Then i used scrolIntoViw({behavior:smooth}) to make moving to sections smooth when they are clicked on the navigation section on the top of the page. The navigation itself was dynamically made to be self created when a new section is made in the HTMLm markup. Sections in the DOM once close to the top will switch to an active class. Showing that it is in view currently.

In this project i used Visual Studio Code to write and debugg the code. You can install Visual Studio Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

In this project there is an index.html file, a js, a css and an images folder.

There is no copyrights here, you may fork the code and change anything as you like.
